# FantasyBasketballProjectionsApp_TDI

##Project Methodology
- Data scraping and wrangling was performed with Requests and Beautiful Soup. Further data manipulation and organization was performed with Pandas.
- Regression analysis and feature importances were derived from Random Forest Regressors.
- Visualizations were made using Matplotlib/Seaborn and Bokeh.
- Web application was developed using HTML stack: JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, CSS/Bootstrap.
- Web application was deployed using Flask, Heroku and Docker.

##Potential Project Value
- 59.3 million people in US and Canada that played fantasy sports in 2017.
- Total of $18 billion is spent on fantasy sports annually. By comparison, $140 billion is wagered on real sports and $70 billion is spent in lotteries.
- Although there are a multitude of websites online that allows free access to historical data, only a few provide projections for future performance which likely charge some sort of fee nor give specifics of how those projections are made. Developing accurate projections would provide a competitive edge.
