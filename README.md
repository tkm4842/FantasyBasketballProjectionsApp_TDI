# FantasyBasketballProjectionsApp_TDI

## Objective
Develop NBA player performance projections for fantasy basketball.

## Background, Potential Project Value
- In fantasy sports, you act as a team manager and build your own team of players. Some players are better than others so each come with their own ‘price tag’ (in the context of average draft position in standard drafts, average auction value in auction drafts, or price in daily formats). Thus, winning in fantasy sports generally comes down to who can most accurately predict which players will outperform their price tag. 
- 59.3 million people in US and Canada that played fantasy sports in 2017.
- Total of $18 billion is spent on fantasy sports annually. By comparison, $140 billion is wagered on real sports and $70 billion is spent in lotteries.
- Although there are a multitude of websites online that allows free access to historical data, only a few provide projections for future performance which likely charge some sort of fee nor give specifics of how those projections are made. Developing accurate projections would provide a competitive edge.

## Project Methodology
- Data scraping and wrangling was performed with Requests and Beautiful Soup. Further data manipulation and organization was performed with Pandas.
- Regression analysis and feature importances were derived from Random Forest Regressors.
- Visualizations were made using Matplotlib/Seaborn and Bokeh.
- Web application was developed using HTML stack: JavaScript, JQuery, Ajax, CSS/Bootstrap.
- Web application was deployed using Flask, Heroku and Docker.
